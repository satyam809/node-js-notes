**Routing in Node.js** is the process of matching a request to a specific endpoint. An endpoint is a function that handles a specific HTTP request. For example, you might have an endpoint that handles GET requests to the `/` path, and another endpoint that handles POST requests to the `/api/users` path.

To implement routing in Node.js, you can use a framework like Express. Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js that provides a simple and efficient way to define and implement routes.

**Step-by-step example of routing in Node.js using Express:**

1. Create a new Node.js project and install the Express package:

```
npm init -y
npm install express
```

2. Create a new file called `server.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

// Define a route for GET requests to the `/` path
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello world!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

3. Start the server by running the following command:

```
node server.js
```

4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the message "Hello world!"

5. To create more routes, simply add new route definitions to the `app` object. For example, the following route definition handles POST requests to the `/api/users` path:

```javascript
app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  // Create a new user
  const user = {
    name: req.body.name,
    email: req.body.email,
  };

  // Save the user to the database
  // ...

  // Send a response to the client
  res.send({ user });
});
```

6. You can also use route parameters to match requests with specific endpoints. For example, the following route definition matches GET requests to the `/users/:id` path:

```javascript
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  // Get the user with the specified ID
  const user = await User.findById(req.params.id);

  // Send the user to the client
  res.send({ user });
});
```

**Conclusion:**

Routing is an essential feature of any web application. By using a framework like Express, you can easily and efficiently implement routing in your Node.js application.
